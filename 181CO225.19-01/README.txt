This folder contains the implementations of different Decision Tree Algorithms and their screenshots.

Decision Tree Classifiers Implemented:

1. ID3 (using Information Gain)
    Accuracy : 94.67% +/- 4.22% (micro average: 94.67%)

2. C4.5 (using Gain Ratio)
    Accuracy : 95.33% +/- 4.50% (micro average: 95.33%)

3. CART (using Gini Index)
    Accuracy : 94.67% +/- 4.22% (micro average: 94.67%)


We can see that C4.5 Model provies the best model with higher accuracy.
