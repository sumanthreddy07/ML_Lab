-----------------------------------------------------------


This folder contains the implementations of different Decision Tree Algorithms and their screenshots.
1. ID3 and CART (in python and Rapidminer)
2. C4.5 (in Rapidminer)


Decision Tree Classifiers Implemented:

1. ID3 (using Information Gain)
    Accuracy : 76.86% +/- 4.60% (micro average: 76.86%)

2. C4.5 (using Gain Ratio)
    Accuracy : 80.35% +/- 4.69% (micro average: 80.35%)

3. CART (using Gini Index)
    Accuracy : 77.07% +/- 3.64% (micro average: 77.07%)


We can see that C4.5 Model provies the best model with higher accuracy.
